          <h2>Part 3: Artificial Intelligience and Machine Learning</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Artifical intelligence and machine learning is a hot topic because of its applications in health care, business, and education.
            Machines that can make informative decisions can have negative consequences when used against humans. 
            In recent time, machines have aided attackers in cracking securiy credentials, finding vulnerabilities in systems, and spoofing identies.
            As these technologies grow and become more widely available it's important to know how to prevent yourself from becoming vulnerable.
          </p>
            <h4> Deep Fakes</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            Deepfakes are manipulated photos generated by computers to mimick photos of real people. The security implications could be tremendous.
            Using a fake photo or altering the facial expressions of a real person could mean putting someone at the wrong place at the wrong time and
            identity theft. While no widely known cases of attackers using deepfakes or similar technologies have emerged we suggest 
            making use of the privacy controls of your online photos. Keep photos private as well as your social media pages. Don't rely on photo rights to 
            protect you; websites can easily scrape your public photos and share them to attackers.
          </p>

            <h4> Using AI to Mimic voice</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                Like DeepFakes, recent progress in AI have allowed machines to mimic real voice. Recently, attackers in London used AI to mimic a CEO's
                voice in order to process a large wire fraud, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402">see more at WSJ.</a>
                There are <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/19/this-ai-is-so-good-at-writing-its-creators-wont-release-it/">technologies</a> also available that can
                impersonate your writing style by reading your emails and texts. An attacker could process this writing style into a text to speech
                technology and create a fake conversation with someone using your voice. While it sounds like much of a stretch, it certainly isn't impossible, 
                that's why we suggest you monitor your online presence and follow this site's cyber secuirty tips so that attackers can't build a cyber profile
                 on you.
              </p>
              <h4> Password Cracking</h4>
                <p class="lead">
              The power of machine learning can be used to crack passwords, if an attacker breaks into a website you use, the site will most likely
              store your password as a encrypted hash. If the password ins't strong, it can be cracked using advanced machine brute force methods to expose
              your password. This will be troublesome if you use that same password on other websites. Read more about passwords in <a href="part4.html">part 4.</a>
              You can also read how password cracking is implemented using <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/analytics/passgan-password-cracking-using-machine-learning/d/d-id/1329964">PassGan.</a>
            </p>
          <h4>Attacking Voice Activated Devices</h4>
          <p class="lead"> 
            SurfingAttack is a collaboration by academic<a href="https://surfingattack.github.io/"> researchers</a> showing that devices which have voice commands
            can be activated through ultrasonic waves. A SurfingAttack or similar could give an attacker information or permission to your phones voice commands 
            such as sending texts and reading emails.

          <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;"> Automated Attacks</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            The power of machines allow processes to be automated without much human oversight. These same processes are used to generate
            targeted phishing schemes and attacks on wide swaths of private email addresses and personal phone numbers. Modern voice over IP systems
            can automate phony phone calls with computer generated voice messages. Thousands of these phone calls can be made every minute without 
            being able to trace the source because of <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing-and-caller-id">caller ID spoofing.</a> While mostly unavoidable,
            it suffices to be aware of when you encounter a <a href="part2.html">phony email</a> or phone call. Likewise, more sohpisticated attackers will automate
            processes that try in order to break or find vulnerabilities in websites and systems.
